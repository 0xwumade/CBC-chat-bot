    answer: `<p>The <strong>CBC EMEA Client Onboarding Process</strong> follows a structured 4-phase approach designed to ensure smooth project kick-off and alignment:</p>
      <p><strong>Phase 1 – Discovery (Days 1–3):</strong> A dedicated Account Manager conducts a requirements workshop with the client's stakeholders. A technical assessment is completed and a Client Profile Document is created.</p>
      <p><strong>Phase 2 – Scoping & Proposal (Days 4–7):</strong> The solutions team reviews requirements, defines deliverables, timelines, and assigns a Lead Consultant. The Statement of Work (SoW) is drafted and reviewed internally before client sign-off.</p>
      <p><strong>Phase 3 – Onboarding Setup (Days 8–14):</strong> System access is provisioned, a Kick-off Meeting is scheduled, and the client is added to the CBC EMEA project portal.</p>
      <p><strong>Phase 4 – Project Initiation:</strong> First sprint or milestone is defined, communication cadence is agreed (weekly check-ins, monthly QBRs), and escalation paths are documented.</p>`,

      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Nordex needed to migrate 14 legacy on-premise servers across 3 European sites to a hybrid Azure/AWS environment — with zero downtime tolerance due to 24/7 wind turbine monitoring systems.</p>
      <p><strong>CBC EMEA Approach:</strong> A phased lift-and-shift strategy was used over 12 weeks. A shadow environment was built in parallel, with a 2-week parallel-run validation before each site cutover.</p>
      <p><strong>Team:</strong> Led by <strong>Senior Consultant Daniel Mwangi</strong> (Cloud Architecture) with support from <strong>Anna Kowalski</strong> (Security) and a 4-person delivery team.</p>
      <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Migration completed 6 days ahead of schedule. 99.97% uptime maintained throughout. Client reported a 34% reduction in infrastructure costs post-migration.</p>`,

      <p><strong>3. Execution</strong> — 2-week sprints for delivery tasks. Weekly internal standups, biweekly client status reports, monthly steering committee meetings.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Quality Assurance</strong> — All deliverables pass through a peer-review gate before client handover. Sign-off tracked via the CBC Delivery Portal.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Closure</strong> — Lessons Learned session, client satisfaction survey, and project archiving into the knowledge base.</p>`,

      <p><strong>Staff Training:</strong> All staff must complete the annual GDPR refresher module on the Learning Portal. New starters complete it within their first 2 weeks.</p>`,
